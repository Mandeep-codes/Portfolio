I care deeply about writing code that’s not just functional, but maintainable, scalable, and user-focused.

Every project I build is a reflection of my mindset: learn deeply, build honestly, and improve continuously.

When I’m not coding:
⚡ Exploring new backend and system design concepts
🧠 Solving DSA & real-world problems to sharpen fundamentals
🚀 Building side projects to turn ideas into working products
🎧 Listening to music or unwinding after a solid coding session`;
